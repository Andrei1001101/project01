Experimental 3d "renderer" made only in C++ and SFML library
The renderer uses the raytracing technique.
The "map", consisting of a set of walls, is a two-dimensional "table" of 0's and 1's, with 0's representing empty spaces, and 1's representing the walls. 
The map can be generated by using the "map generator" which is made in python. 
The renderer also provides a second window which visually represents the "rays" that are being traced and the walls, in a 2D top-down view. 

Important! 
The .exe files do not work at this moment, the program must be ran in an IDE directly from the source code file ("ray.cpp", which can be found in the subfolder "ray").

Bugs and limitations: 
-the camera is turned using the mouse, but can't be turned completely and freely, as it does not calculate the mouse movements, but simply tracks the mouse position relative to the main window;
-the walls sometimes appear to be glitchy and inconsistent because of the limited number of rays that are traced;
-the "fish-eye" effect has not been solved. The fish-eye effect is caused by the basic formula used to calculate the coordinates of the screen where "walls" should be rendered.
